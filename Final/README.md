# Project Write-Up

## CD (for Color Disc)

### Project Goals

To make a "music player" that turns colorful patterns made by visitors into music. 

More specifically, the visitors can put colorful paper scraps on a disc, make it spin (and stop spinning,) and the system will translate the disc into music.



### Technical decisions

To achieve the goal, I use transparent cast acrylic and paper scraps in bright colors as the "disc". I also put an array of four LDRs (light dependent resistors) underneath and RGB sensor above the disc to "read" it. As the visitor pushes a button, a DC motor starts to rotate, driving the plate to spin. Meanwhile, the LDRs and RBG sensor send brightness and RGB data of a certain radius of the disc to an Arduino UNO. The Arduino program then maps the real-time data (weighted brightness level and color of one point) to different music files, which will finally be played by an Adafruit Music Maker Board.

#### Further Considerations

- The motor is even noiser than the disc. Turn up the volume; insulate the motor; or any other way...
- No sound after turned on for a shor period. May be related to the button debounce function.
- Shorter delay time between readings. Or instruct people put less scraps on the disc.
- Wood finishing? ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹
